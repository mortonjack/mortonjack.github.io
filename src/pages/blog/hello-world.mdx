This is my first blog post on this new website. Hooray! Why not spend this time to introduce you to myself? 

I'm Jack, I'm a 20yo non-binary computer science student from Adelaide. I'll be using this blog to post updates about projects I'm working on and
competitions I'm participating in. 
Currently, I'm working on my [sudoku android app](/projects/sudoku 'Sudoku project page'), and learning a lot through Ravi's Study Program. 
In the near future, I'll be part of the Queue Crew at [UNIHACK 2023](unihack.net/ 'UNIHACK'), and Log(Q) for [Ready Trader Go](https://readytradergo.optiver.com/ 'Ready Trader Go') (hoping our team is accepted!)

## Sudoku
Sometimes, I find myself obsessing over sudoku, pulling out it out on my phone whenever I get the chance. But most sudoku apps lock important features
behind paywalls, such as the ability to auto-fill cells with notes at the start of a game, and they leave out others entirely. If I created my own app,
I could make it exactly how I want it. But is it really worth that much effort, just because of a few minor inconveniences? Well, maybe not alone. But
the idea got me thinking, _how in the world are sudoku boards generated??_ That's surely one of the most important parts of a sudoku app! It's this that
really drove me.

I might write up a blog post explaining my process later, but the short version is this: use a fast solving algorithm to generate a complete board. 
Then, randomly remove tiles, and use the same solving algorithm to ensure that at each point, only 1 solution exists. My current process is very fast,
and I'm judging difficulty based on the amount of tiles given at the start of the board, but I wish to improve this. I'm not convinced that the
amount of tiles remaining is a great indicator of difficulty, so I'm working on an improved system to create better games. That's where my project is
for now. [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/mortonjack/sudoku 'Sudoku Repo') to follow development!

## Chess
The project I'm most proud of is definitely the [chess game](/projects/chess 'Chess project page') I made with two of my friends. 
I put a lot of work into it, mainly developing the back-end. 
The highlights are the check & mate detection, draw detection (fifty move rule, stalemate, etc), saving & loading, and our automated testing setup. We used a
test-driven development process, which definitely paid off with all of the finicky little moves chess allows or disallows. I had no idea how complicated
Chess was before I started working on this project, but we wanted to implement every rule, so we did. Yes, including en passant. If you want to check it out
for yourself, [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/mortonjack/chess-oop 'Chess Repo').
