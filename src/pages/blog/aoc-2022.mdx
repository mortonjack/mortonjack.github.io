For those who don't know, Advent of Code is an annual event held during the first 25 days of December. 
You follow a christmas-themed story where each puzzle is one step along the journey. 
Every day, you are provided with a new puzzle containing two parts, and a unique input file. The goal is to extract your answer from the input file. 
The first part usually provides a simpler problem, and the second part adds a twist to it- so maybe part one wants you to find the shortest path
up a mountain from a specific point, and part two wants you to find the shortest path up a mountain from any given point on the ground.
They tend to become more difficult as time moves on. As you complete each days puzzle, the ASCII art on the homepage starts to reveal itself.

In late November, I started a study program called RSP (Ravi's Study Program), and was preparing for my interview to promote from Beginner to Novice.
The beginner phase involved me studying a lot of theory - namely, reading the Algorithm Design Manual, and implementing some common data structures.
I heard Ravi mention Advent of Code as being good practice for parsing input from a file. 
I had some experience there from [developing the save/load system of a chess game](/projects/chess), but I wanted more practice, plus I'd be able to
test my newfound knowledge of algorithms & data structures. When December rolled around, I tried out the first puzzle. Seems pretty easy, find the 
largest item in a list!

*Well,* I thought, *it might be a bit overkill, but I may as well use this to practice implementing a max heap*. This made the second question easy,
when I had to find the top 3 highest numbers. [If you look at my code](https://github.com/mortonjack/adventofcode/blob/main/2022/day1/findtop3.cpp), 
you'll see [how quickly I changed](https://github.com/mortonjack/adventofcode/blob/main/2022/day25/puzzle1.cpp). I was implementing this from scratch, not
even using vectors or anything from the STL. I barely had any experience there, that was for me to learn once I promoted to Novice. 

After I finished the first day, I thought, _that was fun! I can use this to practice what I'm learning, on top of gaining experience with
parsing input from files. I'm going to set myself a challenge to complete each day's puzzle as they come out. How hard can it be?_

As it turns out, it can be very hard.

Days 16, 17, and 22 hold a special place of hatred in my heart. Well, I feel pretty awesome having completed them, but god damn were they difficult!
I was woefully unprepared for advent of code, but I stubbornly refused to give up. Despite the hours of banging my head against a wall trying to come up with a solution, 
or the countless times I had no idea for the life of me why my answer was incorrect, I was right about one thing: it _was_ fun. And that experience
really taught me a lot. I honestly think it was one of the most valuable parts of RSP for me. 

Most people weren't able to participate, but I took the advice of my mentor Devansh and started the theory phase early. Being one of the first people to
promote to Novice, it gave me a lot of 'extra' study time I could spend throughout December on whatever I thought was valuable. I'm definitely not doing this again, 
it's just a combination of luck and forethought that allowed me to have this opportunity, but I'm really glad I had it.

If you'd like to participate, you can [go back to previous years at any time and attempt their puzzles](https://www.adventofcode.com/)! 
I recommend giving it a go with friends, whether by setting up a private leaderboard to compete with each other, 
or working cooperatively to create the best solutions you can.
You can also [view my solutions in my GitHub repo](https://github.com/mortonjack/adventofcode/).
Studying other people's solutions is a fantastic way to learn, you can find many more online. Have fun!
