In my first semester of University, I developed a minesweeper program for my MATLAB & C course. It is console-based and prints instructions for the 
user to follow. It contains an intuitive design with lots of input validation to ensure the game runs smoothly.

The program generates a random minesweeper grid based off customisable input parameters. It can also load a save file. Each move, you have the 
option to reveal, flag, or unflag a tile, or to save and exit the game. The goal is to reveal all tiles which aren't mines. 
When you reveal a tile, it displays the number of adjacent mines.

If there are no adjacent mines, a recursive depth-first search function will automatically reveal all adjacent zeros, and their surrounding tiles.

<BlogImage src={Zeros} alt="Screenshot of the console, showing a user select row 5 column 1 to reveal, which had no adjacent mines, and revealed all adjacent tiles as wel." />

At the end of the game, an image is automatically generated displaying the board so you can share the game you just played.
