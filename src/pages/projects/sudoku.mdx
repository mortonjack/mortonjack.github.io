I'm currently developing a Sudoku app for android. This is my first experience with android app development & Kotlin, my aim is to step outside
my comfort zone and broaden my experiences. I'm also intrigued by the generation of sudoku boards.

The app generates a completed sudoku board using an efficient solving algorithm. This algorithm uses backtracking to identify the first cell with the
smallest number of candidates, then attempts to fill it in with each of its candidates in a random order. Afterwards, it removes a given number of cells
based on the selected difficulty, and uses the same solving algorithm to ensure there are no new valid solutions. It also contains notes, cell highlighting, 
note auto-fill & note auto-clear. I'm currently working on an "undo" button, and a better method for generating sudokus, which bases difficulty off
the techniques required to solve the puzzle, rather than the number of cells removed.
