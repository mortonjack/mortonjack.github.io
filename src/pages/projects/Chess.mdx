The project I'm most proud of is definitely the chess game I made with two of my friends. I put a lot of work into it, mainly developing the back-end. 
The highlights are the check & mate detection, draw detection (fifty move rule, stalemate, etc), saving & loading, and our automated testing setup. We used a
test-driven development process, which definitely paid off with all of the finicky little moves chess allows or disallows. I had no idea how complicated
Chess was before I started working on this project, but we wanted to implement every rule, so we did. Yes, including en passant. If you want to check it out
for yourself, [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/mortonjack/chess-oop 'Chess Repo').
