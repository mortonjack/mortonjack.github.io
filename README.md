# Portfolio Website I

This is my first portfolio website, based off the [No Fuss Astro template](https://github.com/lancerossdev/nofuss).

## Dev Notes üìù

You can use `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I personally use `pnpm` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`pnpm install` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`pnpm dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`pnpm build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`pnpm preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
